- 👋 Hi, I’m @datascientist-cz, I created this new GIT Hub profile to have a tidy copy of the projects that I publish in the portfolio of my personal website https://www.datascientist.cz

- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data analysis, statistics... and basically in almost everything. I was born with an enthusiastic curiosity. See the section Résumé and the section About me of my personal website to check it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science: Power BI, SQL and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I still don=t know. I collaborate on many projects: I serve as a voluntary in a festival on Urban architechture, I collaborate on projects about folklore, I am in to collaborate in any project that makes sense to me.
